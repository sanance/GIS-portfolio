For this assignment, I chose to make a map for the non-profit Vital Strategies. Vital Strategies is an international nonprofit that focuses on restructuring public
health and creating a more equitable and humane world for everyone. I worked for Vital Strategies last summer as an overdose prevention intern and used my GIS skills to create some static maps of overdose prevention resources and demographics. As a result, I wanted to provide an example of a custom map they could use.

The 3 main ways that Vital Strategies breaks up their overdose prevention resources are by region, state, and city.  

<B>Northeast Region</B>

<B>State of Pennsylvania</B>

<B>City of Pittsburgh</B>

The main color palette for Vital Strategies is

However, it is tricky to create a map only using 3 distinct colors. As a result, additional colors were used to enhance the map. The full list of all colors used and their corresponding hex codes is as follows:

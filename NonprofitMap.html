For this assignment, I chose to make a map for the non-profit Vital Strategies. Vital Strategies is an international nonprofit that focuses on restructuring public
health and creating a more equitable and humane world for everyone. I worked for Vital Strategies last summer as an overdose prevention intern and used my GIS skills to create some static maps of overdose prevention resources and demographics. As a result, I wanted to provide an example of a custom map they could use.

The 3 main ways that Vital Strategies breaks up their overdose prevention resources are by region, state, and city.

<br><br><br>The main color palette for Vital Strategies is

<br><br>However, it is tricky to create a map only using 3 distinct colors. As a result, additional colors were used to enhance the map. The full list of all colors used and their corresponding hex codes is as follows:

<pre>
Deep Koamaru:  #141C84  
Bittersweet:   #F7795A  
Bright Sun:    #F9CA3C
White:         #FFFFFF
Coffee Bean:   #321711  
Ebony Clay:    #242F3E  
Persian Blue:  #1B43B1    
</pre>

Here is the json file that indicates which colors are used for each part of creating the custom google map: <a href="https://github.com/sanance/GIS-portfolio/blob/34b75b1ad3db3000a1ac2bcba46f5eca6649ac02/Vital%20Strategies%20Google%20Map.json">Custom Map Color Styles Json</a>
There is also a lookup table that indicates which colors were used for each specific part: <a href="https://github.com/sanance/GIS-portfolio/blob/4c25bf58d30a93b53736d94de81dd50c84403439/Vital%20Strategies%20Color%20Lookup%20Table.docx">Custom Map Color Lookup Table</a>

<br><br><B><font size="+1">Process</font></B>
<br><br>First when creating these maps I went to the Vital Strategies website and took images of the site in order to obtain their general branding and color palette. I uploaded the images to the Canva color palette generator and obtained the 3 main colors that Vital Strategies uses. I then went to the Google Maps Styling Wizard and started playing around with different colors for different parts of the map. For example, should the highways be yellow or coral. I also discovered through this process that only using these 3 main colors plus white was not enough. As a result, I had to find some additional colors that did not distract from the customization, but were needed to enhance the map design. After several iterations of trial and error I eventually decided on the style that is shown above. 

<br><br><B><font size="+1">Design Decision</font></B>
<br><br>I made several design decisions when creating this custom map. First, I chose Deep Koamaru to be the base color for land because this is the main color that Vital Strategies uses in all of their branding. I then chose Bittersweet as the highways and transit because this is the second most popular color in their branding. Lastly, both Bright Sun and White are mainly used as accent colors. After some trial and error I decided that white looked better for the text and Bright Sun worked better for smaller roads and state boundaries. I also specifically chose to make the smaller roads have a lower weight and therefore appear thinner so they didn't clash as much with the bright coral color for the highways.

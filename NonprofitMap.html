For this assignment, I chose to make a map for the non-profit <a href="https://www.vitalstrategies.org/">Vital Strategies</a>. Vital Strategies is an international non-profit that focuses on restructuring public health and creating a more equitable and humane world for everyone. I worked for Vital Strategies last summer as an overdose prevention intern and used my GIS skills to create some static maps of overdose prevention resources and demographics. As a result, I wanted to provide an example of a custom map they could use.

Based on my past experiences, the 3 main ways that Vital Strategies breaks up their overdose prevention resources are by region, state, and city. This is because we often are in contact with regional, state, and local organizations who are interested in our resources and programs in their specific area. As a result, these are the most important scales for the map.

<br><br>The main color palette for Vital Strategies is

<br><br>However, it is tricky to create a map only using 3 distinct colors. As a result, additional colors were used to enhance the map. The full list of all colors used and their corresponding hex codes is as follows:

<pre>
Deep Koamaru:  #141C84  
Bittersweet:   #F7795A  
Bright Sun:    #F9CA3C
White:         #FFFFFF
Coffee Bean:   #321711  
Ebony Clay:    #242F3E  
Persian Blue:  #1B43B1    
</pre>

Here is the json file that indicates which colors are used for each part of creating the custom google map: <a href="https://github.com/sanance/GIS-portfolio/blob/34b75b1ad3db3000a1ac2bcba46f5eca6649ac02/Vital%20Strategies%20Google%20Map.json">Custom Map Color Styles Json</a>
<br>There is also a lookup table that indicates which colors were used for each specific part: <a href="https://github.com/sanance/GIS-portfolio/blob/4c25bf58d30a93b53736d94de81dd50c84403439/Vital%20Strategies%20Color%20Lookup%20Table.docx">Custom Map Color Lookup Table</a>

<br><br><B><font size="+1">Process</font></B>
<br><br>First when creating these maps I went to the Vital Strategies website and took images of the site in order to obtain their general branding and color palette. I uploaded the images to the Canva color palette generator and obtained the 3 main colors that Vital Strategies uses. I then went to the Google Maps Styling Wizard and started trying different colors for different parts of the map. For example, I investigated if the the highways should be yellow (Bright Sun) or coral (Bittersweet). I also discovered through this process that only using these 3 main colors plus white was not enough and the map design felt flat and uninspired. As a result, I had to find some additional colors that did not distract from the overall look and branding, but were needed to enhance the map design. After several iterations of trial and error I eventually decided on the style that is shown above. I then specifically zoomed in to the region level, state level, and city level because these are the most common scales used in my past work with Vital Strategies.

<br><br>I made several design decisions when creating this custom map. First, I chose Deep Koamaru to be the base color for land because this is the primary color that Vital Strategies uses in all of their branding. I then chose Bittersweet as the highways and transit because this is the second most popular color in their branding. Lastly, both Bright Sun and White are mainly used as accent colors. After some trial and error I decided that white looked better for the text and Bright Sun worked better for smaller roads and state boundaries. I also specifically chose to make the smaller roads have a lower weight and therefore appear thinner so they didn't clash as much with the bright coral color for the highways. I think a lot of the design choices I made were influenced by my past internship at the organization. For example, in my personal experience with the company, I felt the coral shade, Bittersweet, was the most commonly used accent color based on various documents I worked with. However, this could be unique to my personal experience and perhaps the company views Bright Sun as their secondary color. If I were to implement this in the real world, having a meeting to discuss color choices would be one of my biggest priorities.

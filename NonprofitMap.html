For this assignment, I chose to make a map for the non-profit Vital Strategies. Vital Strategies is an international nonprofit that focuses on restructuring public
health and creating a more equitable and humane world for everyone. I worked for Vital Strategies last summer as an overdose prevention intern and used my GIS skills to create some static maps of overdose prevention resources and demographics. As a result, I wanted to provide an example of a custom map they could use.

The 3 main ways that Vital Strategies breaks up their overdose prevention resources are by region, state, and city.

The main color palette for Vital Strategies is

However, it is tricky to create a map only using 3 distinct colors. As a result, additional colors were used to enhance the map. The full list of all colors used and their corresponding hex codes is as follows:

<pre>
Deep Koamaru:  #141C84  
Bittersweet:   #F7795A  
Bright Sun:    #F9CA3C  
Coffee Bean:   #321711  
Ebony Clay:    #242F3E  
Persian Blue:  #1B43B1  
White:         #FFFFFF  
Downriver:     #0C1050
</pre>

<B>Process and Design Decisions</B>
First when creating these maps I went to the Vital Strategies website and took images of the site in order to obtain their general branding and color palette. I uploaded the images to the Canva color palette generator and obtained the 3 main colors that Vital Strategies uses.

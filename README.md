# About me
Hi, I'm Sarah! I'm a second year Masters student in the Masters of Science in Public Policy and Management - Data Analytics Program at Carnegie Mellon's Heinz College. Previously, I received my bachelors in Policy Analysis from Indiana University. I mentioned this in class, but I don't like chocolate and I also don't like coffee or mint either! In my free time I enjoy hiking, fashion, sports, and traveling.

In general, I am interested in the intersection of data science and public health, and more particularly substance use and the overdose epidemic. Last summer I was able to use GIS in my internship where I focused on cataloging overdose prevention resources and their accessibility to the populations they are supposed to serve. I created a variety of maps to show stakeholders and advocate for various harm reduction programs we supported. Separately, I'm currently in the middle of TA-ing the Heinz introductory GIS course under professor Kristen Kurland for the 3rd semester in a row. I've truly enjoyed my time as a TA for this course and really appreciate how much I have learned about GIS from teaching others. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn more about using data science and Python programming in combination with GIS. In the future I hope to be a data analyst/data scientist that focuses on using data for improving public health. As a result, the main way I hope to use GIS in my future career is by combining it with data science techniques and modeling.  

I'd also really enjoy learning how to integrate GIS maps with webpages. Last summer in my internship most of my maps were static because they were used in reports and briefs, however towards the end it was apparent that moving forward the focus would be on creating maps hosted on websites that had built-in pipelines so they could be updated regularly. Creating a built-in pipeline that automatically updates or can be hosted online and very easily updated is something I would love to be able to do as I can see many use cases for this work. I would have enjoyed staying on longer with my internship just to learn how we would go about this process as it is something I am unfamiliar with and can see being incredibly useful moving forward.
